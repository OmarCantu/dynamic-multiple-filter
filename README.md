The technology stack includes react.js, redux.js, redux-observable.js, among others.

### 1. Requirements:

## 3. Notes
- A zeplin mock would have helped a lot.
- Things I would have liked to add to the project, but didn't due to time constraints:

1. unit testing,
2. cross-browser testing,
3. add more to the global state and switch some stateful components to stateless
4. test in linux
5. accessibility
6. more webpack configs
7. put filters on overlay in mobile
